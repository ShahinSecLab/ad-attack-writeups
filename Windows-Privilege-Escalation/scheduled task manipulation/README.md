## Introduction

Scheduled Task Manipulation is a local privilege escalation technique. When a scheduled task runs a script or binary as SYSTEM and that script or binary has weak file permissions, a low privilege user can modify it. The next time the task runs, it executes the modified script as SYSTEM — giving full control of the machine without needing any exploit or CVE.

## Why This Attack Works

Windows scheduled tasks often run as SYSTEM to perform maintenance jobs like cleaning logs, running backups, or updating software. If the script or binary that the task runs has weak permissions — meaning normal users can write to it — I can add my own commands to that script. The next time the task fires, Windows runs my commands as SYSTEM.
The key thing here is I do not need to touch the task itself. I just modify the script it runs.

## Lab Setup

```
|    Component     |         Details         |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Attacker Machine | Kali Linux              |
| Attacker IP      | 192.168.5.128           |
| Victim Machine   | Windows 10 (MSEDGEWIN10)|
| Victim IP        | 192.168.5.144           |
| Network          | VMware Host-Only Network|
| Domain           | WORKGROUP               |
```

## Tools Prepared on Kali Before Starting

```
| Tool            | Location                    | Purpose                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| accesschk.exe   | /home/kali/Desktop/tools/   | Check file permissions                  |
| rev.exe         | C:\PrivEsc\ on victim       | Malicious payload already on the victim |
| Metasploit      | Built into Kali             | Catch reverse shells                    |
```

## What I Needed Before Starting

```
|                   What                | Why                                   |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Low privilege Meterpreter shell       | Starting point for the attack         |
| accesschk.exe                       | To check file permissions on scripts  |
| rev.exe already on the victim       | Payload to execute as SYSTEM          |
| Metasploit listener                   | To catch the shell when the task fires|
```

## What I Understood During the Process

While working through this attack I realized that:

- Scheduled tasks running as SYSTEM are very common in Windows environments
- If the script a task runs is writable by normal users, the machine is open to this attack
- I did not need to touch the scheduled task itself — just the script it runs
- The attack is completely passive once the payload is injected — I just wait for the task to fire
- Always check custom folders like C:\DevTools, C:\BGinfo, C:\Temp — admins often leave weak permissions on these

## Attack Flow

```
Already had a low privilege Meterpreter shell on the victim
                        ↓
Dropped into a CMD shell and explored C:\
                        ↓
Found C:\DevTools folder with CleanUp.ps1 inside
                        ↓
Opened CleanUp.ps1 — comment said it runs every minute as SYSTEM
                        ↓
Checked file permissions with accesschk.exe
                        ↓
Found full write access for normal users on CleanUp.ps1
                        ↓
Appended C:\PrivEsc\rev.exe to the end of CleanUp.ps1
                        ↓
Started Metasploit listener on port 4444
                        ↓
Waited for the scheduled task to fire
                        ↓
Task ran CleanUp.ps1 as SYSTEM — hit the injected line
                        ↓
rev.exe executed as SYSTEM
                        ↓
Metasploit caught the shell
                        ↓
Meterpreter session opened as SYSTEM
