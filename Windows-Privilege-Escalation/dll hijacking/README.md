# Introduction

DLL Hijacking is a privilege escalation technique that takes advantage of how Windows loads DLL files. When a service or program looks for a DLL, Windows searches through a list of folders in a specific order. If I can drop a malicious DLL in a folder that Windows checks before the real one — and that folder is writable by normal users — Windows loads my DLL instead. Since the service runs as SYSTEM, my malicious DLL runs as SYSTEM too.

# Why This Attack Works

When a Windows service starts, it loads DLL files it needs to run. Windows searches for those DLL files in this order:
```
1. The folder where the application is installed
2. C:\Windows\System32
3. C:\Windows\System
4. C:\Windows
5. The current working directory
6. Folders listed in the PATH environment variable
```
If a folder early in that search order is writable by normal users, I can drop a malicious DLL there. Windows picks it up before ever finding the real one — and runs it as `SYSTEM`.

## Lab Setup

```
|    Component     |         Details         |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Attacker Machine | Kali Linux              |
| Attacker IP      | 192.168.5.128           |
| Victim Machine   | Windows 10 (MSEDGEWIN10)|
| Victim IP        | 192.168.5.144           |
| Network          | VMware Host-Only Network|
| Domain           | WORKGROUP               |
```


## Tools Prepared on Kali Before Starting

```
|       Tool     |          Location         |            Purpose              |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| winPEASany.exe | /home/kali/Desktop/tools/ | Find privilege escalation paths |
| accesschk.exe  | /home/kali/Desktop/tools/ | Check service permissions       |
| msfvenom       | Built into Kali           | Generate malicious DLL payload  |
| Metasploit     | Built into Kali           | Catch reverse shells            |
| Python3        | Built into Kali           | Host files over HTTP            |
```

## What I Needed Before Starting

```
|         What                      |                          Why                            |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Low-privilege shell on the victim | Starting point for the privilege escalation attack.     |
| winPEAS                           | To identify services with weak binary file permissions. |
| accesschk.exe                     | To verify the permissions on the service executable.    |
| msfvenom                          | To generate the malicious DLL                           |
| Metasploit                        | To receive the reverse Meterpreter session.             |
```

## What I Understood During the Process
While working through this attack I realized that:

- Windows trusting folders in the PATH to load DLLs is a big security risk
- If any folder in the DLL search order is writable by normal users, the machine is open to this attack
- The DLL payload is different from an EXE payload — you have to use -f dll in msfvenom
- hashdump only works from Meterpreter, not from a CMD shell
- Once you get a SYSTEM Meterpreter session, you can dump every password hash on the machine in one command

## Attack Flow

Already had a low privilege Meterpreter shell on the victim
                        ↓
Ran winPEAS — flagged C:\Temp as writable by Authenticated Users
                        ↓
Checked service permissions with accesschk.exe
                        ↓
Found SERVICE_START and SERVICE_STOP for dllsvc
                        ↓
Checked service config — dllsvc runs as LocalSystem (SYSTEM)
                        ↓
Started dllsvc to confirm it loads DLLs from C:\Temp
                        ↓
Generated malicious hijackme.dll on Kali with msfvenom
                        ↓
Started Metasploit listener on port 4444
                        ↓
Downloaded hijackme.dll to C:\Temp on the victim using certutil
                        ↓
Stopped and restarted dllsvc
                        ↓
Service loaded hijackme.dll from C:\Temp as SYSTEM
                        ↓
Metasploit caught the shell
                        ↓
whoami → nt authority\system
                        ↓
Ran hashdump — dumped all password hashes from the machine
