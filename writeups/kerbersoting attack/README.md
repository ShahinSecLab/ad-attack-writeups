## What is Kerberoasting?

In Windows networks, services (like SQL Server, IIS, etc.) are registered with something called an SPN (Service Principal Name). When a user wants to access a service, Windows gives them an encrypted service ticket. That ticket is encrypted using the service account's password hash.
Here is the problem — any logged-in domain user can request that ticket, no special permissions needed. An attacker can grab that ticket, take it offline, and crack it to recover the real password.

## How Kerberoasting Works

```
Domain User
     |
     | Requests TGS Ticket
     v
Domain Controller
     |
     | Returns Ticket
     | Encrypted with Service Account Password
     v
Attacker Extracts Ticket
     |
     | Offline Password Cracking
     v
Service Account Password Recovered
```
