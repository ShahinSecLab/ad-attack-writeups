## What is LLMNR?

LLMNR stands for **Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution.**

Windows uses this when it cannot find a computer name through DNS. When DNS fails, Windows shouts to the whole network:

> *"Hey, does anyone know where \\fileserver is?"*

The problem is — any machine on the network can reply. So an attacker can say *"Yeah, that's me!"* and the victim sends their password hash without knowing.

## Protocol Order (Windows Name Resolution)

- **DNS** → tries first  
- **mDNS** → tries second  
- **LLMNR** → tries third (can be abused)  
- **NBT-NS** → tries last (can also be abused)
