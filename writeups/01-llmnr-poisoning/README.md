\## What is LLMNR?



LLMNR stands for \*\*Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution.\*\*



Windows uses this when it cannot find a computer name through DNS. When DNS fails, Windows shouts to the whole network:



> \*"Hey, does anyone know where \\\\fileserver is?"\*



The problem is — any machine on the network can reply. So an attacker can say \*"Yeah, that's me!"\* and the victim sends their password hash without knowing.

\## How the Attack Works



Victim                          Attacker

|                                |

| Hey DNS, where is fileserver?  |

| DNS says: I don't know         |

|                                |

| broadcasts to whole network    |

| "Anyone know fileserver?"      |

|                                |

|     Attacker says: "I do!"     |

|                                |

| Victim sends password hash --->|

|                          Attacker captures hash

\## Lab Setup



| Machine | OS | IP |

|---------|----|----|

| Attacker | Kali Linux | 192.168.1.105 |

| Victim | Windows 10 | 192.168.1.110 |



Both machines on same VirtualBox Host-Only network.

\## Attack Steps



\### Step 1 — Check Your IP



```bash

ip a

```



Output:

eth0: 192.168.1.105



\---



\### Step 2 — Start Responder



```bash

sudo responder -I eth0 -dwv

```



| Flag | Meaning |

|------|---------|

| `-I eth0` | Network interface |

| `-d` | DHCP poisoning |

| `-w` | WPAD proxy server |

| `-v` | Verbose mode |

\### Step 3 — Trigger from Victim Machine



On Windows victim, open File Explorer and type:
